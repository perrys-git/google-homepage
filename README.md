A mini-project to learn/demonstrate how to use Developer tools to deconstruct and rebuild an existing webpage.

Summary

Used html and css to construct a clone of the google homepage. 

Learned a little bit about flex. 
Learned a little bit about developer tools and how to use them. 
  Kept having an overflow problem. Isolated it to my footer and header areas. 
  Was using "width: 100%" in each and it was causeing overflow I think because of padding.  
 Learned a little about how to use git
 Overall, had a bunch of fun fixing weird things, and styling the page.
